1. What is Kafka?
   - Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling high-throughput, low-latency data streams. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

2. Kafka Architecture
   - Kafka's architecture is designed for scalability and fault tolerance. It consists of several components including producers, consumers, brokers, topics, and partitions.

3. Components of Kafka
   - Producer: Sends data to Kafka topics.
   - Consumer: Reads data from Kafka topics.
   - Broker: Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.
   - Topic: A category or feed name to which records are published.
   - Partition: Subdivision of a topic for parallel processing.

4. Core API Architecture of Kafka
   - Producer API: Allows applications to send data to Kafka topics.
   - Consumer API: Allows applications to read data from Kafka topics.
   - Streams API: Sam as Consumer API but it can the ability to edit the read messages.
   - Connect API: Integrates Kafka with external systems.

5. Apache Kafka Events
   - Kafka events are the records or messages that are produced and consumed by applications.

6. Kafka Clusters
   - Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers working together to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

7. Kafka Architecture Replica
   - Kafka uses replication to ensure data durability and high availability. Each partition can have multiple replicas.

8. Kafka Architecture Schema
   - Kafka supports schema management to ensure data consistency and compatibility.

9. Handling High Volume of Data
   - Kafka handles high volumes of data efficiently through partitioning and replication. For example, it can process millions of messages per second.

10. Producer Configuration
    - Key configurations include:
      - Bootstrap Servers: Initial set of Kafka brokers.
      - Acks: Acknowledgment settings (0, 1, all).
      - Batch Size: Size of batches for sending records.
      - Compression Type: Compression settings (e.g., gzip, snappy).
      - Retries: Number of retry attempts for failed sends.

11. Consumer Configuration
    - Key configurations include:
      - Bootstrap Servers: Initial set of Kafka brokers.
      - Group.id: Consumer group identifier.
      - Enable.auto.commit: Automatic offset commit settings.
      - Auto.commit.interval.ms: Interval for auto commits.
      - Auto.offset.reset: Offset reset policy.
      - Max.poll.records: Maximum number of records to fetch.
      - Fetch.min.bytes and Fetch.max.wait.ms: Fetch settings.

12. Consumer Group Coordinator
    - Responsible for coordination, load balancing, rebalancing, and fault tolerance within consumer groups.

13. ZooKeeper
    - ZooKeeper is used for managing and coordinating Kafka brokers.

14. Apache Kafka Not Recommended For
    - Kafka is not ideal for scenarios requiring complex transactions or low-latency processing of small messages.

15. Consumer Lag
    - Consumer lag refers to the delay between the latest record in a partition and the record being processed by the consumer.

16. Types of Lag
    - Different types of lag include end-to-end latency, processing lag, and network lag.

17. Strategies to Address Lag
    - Strategies include optimizing consumer configurations, increasing partition count, and improving network infrastructure.

18. Guarantees Provided by Kafka
    - Kafka provides guarantees such as message durability, fault tolerance, and exactly-once processing semantics.
